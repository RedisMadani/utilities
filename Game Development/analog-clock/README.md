# Analog Clock

This is a simple analog clock program implemented in C++. It displays the current time using a graphical interface.

## Features

- Real-time display of the current time with hour, minute, and second hands.
- Smooth animation of the clock hands updating every second.
- Simple and intuitive graphical interface.

## Technologies Used

- C++: The programming language used for implementing the clock.
- [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/): A simple and fast multimedia library used for rendering the clock graphics.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Analog Clock program on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/RedisMadani/analog-clock.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd analog-clock`
3. Build the program using your preferred C++ compiler. For example:
   - Using g++: `g++ -o analog_clock main.cpp -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system`
   - Using Visual Studio: Create a new project, add the source files, and configure SFML as a dependency.
4. Run the compiled executable or start the program from your IDE.

## Usage

Once you run the Analog Clock program, it will open a window displaying the clock. The clock hands will continuously update in real-time to reflect the current time.

```

3. Run the game:

```

## How to Play

- The game is played by two players.
- Player A controls the left paddle with the 'W' key to move up and the 'S' key to move down.
- Player B controls the right paddle with the up arrow key to move up and the down arrow key to move down.
- The objective is to bounce the ball off the paddles and prevent it from going past your own paddle.
- Each time the ball passes a paddle, the opposing player scores a point.
- The first player to reach 11 points wins the game.

This is an Arkanoid game implemented in C# using Visual Studio. It is a classic arcade game where the player controls a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks.

## Features

- Paddle control: Use the mouse or keyboard to move the paddle horizontally and prevent the ball from falling off the screen.
- Ball movement: The ball moves around the screen and bounces off walls, the paddle, and bricks.
- Brick destruction: Break bricks by hitting them with the ball. Each brick has a different durability level.
- Power-ups: Collect power-ups that fall from destroyed bricks to gain special abilities or enhancements.
- Multiple levels: Play through a series of increasingly challenging levels with different arrangements of bricks.
- Score tracking: Keep track of the player's score based on the number of bricks destroyed.
- Lives system: Start with a certain number of lives and lose one each time the ball falls off the screen. The game ends when all lives are lost.

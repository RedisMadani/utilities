This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and Pygame.

## Prerequisites

Before running the game, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RedisMadani/snake-py.git
```

2. Change to the project directory:

```bash
cd snake-py
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
- The objective is to eat the food (red cubes) to grow longer.
- Avoid colliding with the walls or your own body, as it will result in game over.

## Usage

To start the game, run the following command:

```bash
python snake_game.py
```

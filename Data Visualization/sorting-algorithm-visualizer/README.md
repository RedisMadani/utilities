# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This program is a sorting algorithm visualizer that allows you to visualize the different steps of sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort and Merge Sort. You can input comma-separated numbers, select the sorting algorithm, adjust the animation speed, and watch as the program animates the sorting process using bars on a canvas.

## Installation and Requirements
- This program runs on Python 3.
- To install the required packages, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- To run the program, execute `python main.py`.

## Usage
1. Enter comma-separated numbers in the input field.
2. Select the sorting algorithm (Bubble Sort or Merge Sort).
3. Adjust the speed slider if necessary.
4. Click on the Sort button to visualize the algorithm.
5. Use Shuffle and Reset buttons to shuffle and reset the input data.

## Features
- Input field for comma-separated numbers
- Buttons for sorting, shuffling, and resetting the input data
- Dropdown for selecting the sorting algorithm
- Slider for controlling the speed of the animation
- Canvas for displaying the input data and the sorting process
- Animates sorting algorithm steps using bars on a canvas

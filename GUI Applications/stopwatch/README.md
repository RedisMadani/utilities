## Description:
Stopwatch is a sleek and efficient iOS app that accurately measures the amount of time elapsed from a particular starting point. Inspired by Apple's official Clock app stopwatch, this application provides a feature-rich experience for tracking time intervals. With support for lap records, time resumption, and stopwatch reset, Stopwatch is designed to meet your timing needs with ease.

## Features:

### 1. Stopwatch Functionality:
The core functionality of Stopwatch is the stopwatch feature itself. You can start and stop the stopwatch at any time, allowing you to measure elapsed time precisely. The stopwatch displays hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds for accurate time tracking.

### 2. Lap Record:
Stopwatch supports lap recording, enabling you to mark specific points in time while the stopwatch is running. By tapping the lap button, you can record and store lap times, which can be useful for tracking intermediate times or creating split time analysis.

### 3. Time Resume:
With the time resume feature, you can pause the stopwatch and then resume it from the same point later. This allows you to temporarily halt the timing without losing the actual elapsed time.

### 4. Stopwatch Reset:
If needed, you can reset the stopwatch to its initial state, clearing all recorded lap times and resetting the elapsed time to zero. This function is handy when you want to start a new timing session or reset the stopwatch after completing a measurement.

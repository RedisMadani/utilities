# Smart Lamp Control Script

This is a Python script that allows you to control any kind of smart lamp using a variety of settings and options. The script is designed to be highly compatible and flexible, allowing you to control your smart lamp with ease.

## Getting Started

To use this script, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer. You'll also need to install the appropriate library for your smart lamp. For example, if you have a Yeelight smart lamp, you'll need to install the `yeelight` library.

You can install the `yeelight` library using pip:

```
pip install yeelight
```

Once you've installed the appropriate library for your lamp, you can run the script by opening a terminal or command prompt, navigating to the directory where the script is located, and running the following command:

```
python smart_lamp_control.py
```

The script will prompt you to enter the name of the module for your smart lamp (e.g. "yeelight"). It will then discover all smart lamps on the network using the module's `discover_bulbs()` function. For each lamp found, it will prompt you to specify the desired settings, such as on/off state, brightness level, color temperature or RGB values, HSB values, color flow mode, scheduled on/off times, transition time, color temperature range, firmware version, music mode brightness, smoothness value, color temperature as a percentage of the full range, and power state.

## Compatibility

This script should work with any kind of smart lamp, as long as you have installed the appropriate library for your lamp and it supports the features used in the script.
